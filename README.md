Agile7 Software Energy-Efficiency Implementation Roadmap
--------------------------------------------------------
Agile7 is implementing the following four phases in order to help make software more energy efficient.

### Phase 1: Identify the Business Landscape.
- ***Part 1:*** Identify risks in the ICT industry macro environment that would be caused by a continuous expansion of carbon emission regulations and energy-efficiency requirements. Find strategies to mitigate those risks and then identify their contingencies.

- ***Part 2:*** Given this macro environment, identify the point at which the adoption of software energy-efficiency services reaching critical mass can be identified.

### Phase 2: Identify the Tactics.
- ***Part 1***: Identify, group, and categorize the architectural tactics that can be used to improve software energy-efficiency. Give implementation suggestions in some tactics.

- ***Part 2***: Document hardware and software-specific energy-optimization tactics.

### Phase 3: Create Processes.
- ***Part 1:*** Create processes for tactics from the previous step and place them into a hierarchical structure that is grouped into one or multiple orchestration categories.

- ***Part 2:*** Identify process and orchestration gaps in order to identify needed tools for the next phase.

### Phase 4: Create Tools.
- ***Part 1:*** Identify existing tools and create new tools that are used to fulfill process requirements from the previous phase.
